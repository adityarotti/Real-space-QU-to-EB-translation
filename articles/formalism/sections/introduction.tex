\section{Introduction}
The Cosmic Mircowave Background is 10 percent polarized, but the polarization contains independent cosmological information.

Standard technique is to convert Stokes parameters into scalar and pseudo-scalar modes, which are easier to compare to theory.

The pseudo-scalar $B$ mode is particularly important because it cannot be generated by primordial scalar pertubations

primordial tensor perturbations

lensing of $E$-modes

systematics checks

exotic phenemena like cosmic birefringence

The spin-0 $E$/$B$ modes relate to the spin-2 Stokes parameters via the spin-raising and -lowering operators ($\eth,\bar \eth$), which are second derivatives evaulated locally.  However, in practice we compute $E$/$B$ modes to a specified band limit, and this makes them non-local functions of the polarization field.  In other words, the $E$/$B$ modes at a point can get contributions from all over the sky.

Zaldarriaga explored the spatial real-space kernels in the flat-sky approximation \citep{}.


In this work we follow the convection in which bar-ed variables correspond to those in real space, while the tilde-ed variables correspond to those in harmonic space \cite{Zaldarriaga2001a}. 

This paper is organized in the following manner: In \sec{sec:pol-intro} we present a primer on the description of CMB polarization on the sphere and introduce the matrix notation which provides a more concise description of the same. In \sec{sec:real_space_operators} we introduce the necessary tools  and discuss the derivations of the real space operators. In \sec{sec:visualize_operator} we evaluate the real space operators and present visualizations of these functions. Here we also discuss the locality of the real space E \& B operators. In \sec{sec:numerical_implementation} we implement these operators to evaluate E \& B  maps from the Stokes parameters Q \& U and compare these maps and their spectra from those derived using Healpix. We conclude with a discussion and the scope of this new method of analyzing CMB polarization in \sec{sec:discussion}.
