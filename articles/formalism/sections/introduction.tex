\section{Introduction}
The Cosmic Mircowave Background is 10 percent polarized, but the polarization contains independent cosmological information.

Standard technique is to convert Stokes parameters into scalar and pseudo-scalar modes, which are easier to compare to theory.

The pseudo-scalar $B$ mode is particularly important because it cannot be generated by primordial scalar pertubations

lensing of $E$-modes

systematics checks

exotic phenemena like cosmic birefringence

The spin-0 $E$/$B$ modes relate to the spin-2 Stokes parameters via the spin-raising and -lowering operators ($\eth,\bar \eth$), which are second derivatives evaulated locally.  However, in practice we compute $E$/$B$ modes to a specified band limit, and this makes them non-local functions of the polarization field.  In other words, the $E$/$B$ modes at a point can get contributions from all over the sky.

Zaldarriaga explored the spatial real-space kernels in the flat-sky approximation \citep{}.

In this work we follow the convection in which bar-ed variables correspond to those in real space, while the tilde-ed variables correspond to those in harmonic space \cite{Zaldarriaga2001a}. 

This paper is organized in the following manner: In \sec{sec:pol-primer} we present a primer on the description of CMB polarization on the sphere. Here we begin with a heuristic argument that makes transparent the real space construction of E/B modes on the sphere. We then discuss the standard harmonic space procedures for this operation. Finally we introduce the matrix-vector notation which yields a more concise description of the harmonic space procedures. In \sec{sec:real_space_operators} we derive and discuss the real space operators that transform Q/U to E/B and vice versa. In \sec{sec:visualize_operator} we evaluate these real space operators and present visualizations of these functions. We also derive a real space operator that decomposes the Stokes Q/U  parameters into components that correspond to E and B modes respectively.  Here we also discuss the locality of the real space E \& B operators. In \sec{sec:numerical_implementation} we implement these operators to evaluate E \& B  maps from the Stokes parameters Q \& U and compare these maps and their spectra from those derived using Healpix. We conclude with a discussion and the scope of this new method of analyzing CMB polarization in \sec{sec:discussion}.
